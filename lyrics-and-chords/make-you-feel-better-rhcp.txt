[Verse]
 Em     Bm      C        G
 She's the one she's the only one
 She's got ripped back light
 Gonna make me come
 I say... when I smile I'm a really smile
 I got dreams so wide like a country mile
  
 I said now, I'll take it
 It's better for you
 Somehow we'll make it
 'cause that's what we do
  
 Pick a star in the open sky
 I see you see me
 And that is why I
  
 Hop along to the cowboy beat
 When I feel your fire
 Jump up to meet
  
 I said now, I'll take it
 It's better for you
 Somehow we'll make it
 'cause that's what we do
  
  
 [Chorus]
 G     D     Em     C
 Something out there
 Where love is your only friend and
 We are the ones
 That will make you feel better and
 Someone to spare
 When love is the only end and
 We are the ones
 That will make you feel better
 Oh yeah
  
  
 [Verse]
 Em     Bm      C        G
 In a world that has run amok
 I've got to set my sights
 Just to get struck
  
 I walk away from the rank and file
 With a punched out mouth
 And a pack of style
  
 I say... she's the one she's the only one
 Make me search myself
 Until I'm done... and
  
 Tell me now in a telegram
 Do the sea of stars
 Make a diagram... and
  
  
 [Chorus]
 G     D     Em     C
 Something out there
 Where love is your only friend and
 We are the ones
 That will make you feel better and
 Someone to spare
 When love is the only end and
 We are the ones
 That will make you feel better
 Oh yeah
  
  
 [Verse]
 Em     Bm      C        G
 So alive I arrive on dust
 You can search my mind
 For the red on rust... I said
 Take me there and she really cares
 Lights up for me gonna hear my prayers
 I said
  
 I said now, I'll take it
 It's better for you
 Somehow we'll make it
 'cause that's what we do
  
  
 [Chorus]
 G     D     Em     C
 Something out there
 Where love is your only friend and
 We are the ones
 That will make you feel better and
 Someone to spare
 When love is the only end and
 We are the ones
 That will make you feel better
 Oh yeah
