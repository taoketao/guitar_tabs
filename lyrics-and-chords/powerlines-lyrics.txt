Intro: Am Am/B C C* C * C

Am                Am/B      C
The days are long, and they sing you a song
Fadd9  C       Fadd9        C
About how all your troubles are gone
Am              Am/B       C
We hold it all inside our sunlight hands
Fadd9    C              Fadd9    C
We'll never let it go, I think you understand
Am             Am/B     C
We drive around all the mystery towns
Fadd9   C         Fadd9       C
I can see it now, it's all in my head
Am          Am/B     C
Staring down at the gravity ground
Fadd9     C             Fadd9       C
When you're this high up, you never wanna come down

G                          F                     C
When I was lost in your eyes, was I trying to find
G         F              C          C/B
A way beyond all the palm tree powerlines

Am Am/B Fadd9 C Fadd9     C
wooooooo I do what I can

Am             Am/B C
Dreaming dreams of material things
Fadd9    C        Fadd9   C
I try to wake you up, I do what I can
Am             Am/B     C
Let me take you to some places I've seen
Fadd9      C     Fadd9               C
Down a two lane road, I know right where it goes

G                          F                     C
When I was lost in your eyes, was I trying to find
G         F              C          C/B
A way beyond all the palm tree powerlines

The days are long, and they sing you a song
About how all your troubles are gone
We hold it all inside our sunlight hands
We'll never let it go, I think you understand

We drive around all the mystery towns
I can see it now, it's all in my head
Staring down at the gravity ground
When you're this high up, you never wanna come down

When I was lost in your eyes, was I trying to find
A way beyond all the palm tree powerlines
(wooo... I do what I can)

Dreaming dreams of material things
I try to wake you up, I do what I can
Let me take you to some places I've seen
Down a two lane road, I know right where it goes

When I was lost in your eyes, was I trying to find
A way beyond all the palm tree powerlines

(wooo... I do what I can)
(wooo... I do what I can)

When I was lost in your eyes, was I trying to find
A way beyond all the palm tree powerlines
