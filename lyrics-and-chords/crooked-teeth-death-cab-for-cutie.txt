Crooked Teeth
 Death Cab for Cutie
  
  
 [Verse 1]
 Em7     A7        C         G         Em7   A7     C      G
    It was one hundred degrees as we sat beneath a willow tree
       Em7           A7              C           G
 Whose tears didn't care, they just hung in the air
        Em7      A7       C   G  N.C.
 And refused to fall, to fall
 Em7  A7              C        G
   I knew I'd made a horrible call
      Em7            A7                 C     G
 And now the state line felt like the Berlin Wall
            Em7     A7               C          G  Em7  A7  C  G
 And there was no doubt about which side I was on mhmm...
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
 Em7       B7          G           B7
   Cause I built you a home in my heart
      Em7    B7           G              A7
 With rotten wood, that decayed from the start
  
  
 [Chorus]
           C           G          D
 Cause you can't find nothin' at all
           C           G          D
 if there was nothin' there all along
          C          G          D
 No, you can't find nothin' at all
           C           G         D      N.C.
 if there was nothin' there all along

 [Verse 2]
 Em7   A7       C          G          Em7         A7      C        G
    I braved treacherous streets, and kids strung out on homemade speed,
         Em7     A7             C         G        Em7      A7      C       G
 and we shared a bed in which I could not sleep at all, woo-hoo woo-hoo-o-o-oo
 Em7          A7        C      G
    Cause at night the sun in retreat
          Em7      A7        C       G
 Made the skyline look like crooked teeth
        Em7        A7          C      G     Em7  A7  C  G
 In the mouth of a man who was devouring us both
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
 Em7          B7               G             B7
   You're so cute when you're slurring your speech,
              Em7         B7           G           A7
 But they're closing the bar and they want us to leave
  
  
 [Chorus]
          C           G         D
 And you can't find nothin' at all
           C           G          D
 if there was nothin' there all along
          C          G          D
 No, you can't find nothin' at all
           C           G         D
 if there was nothin' there all along
  
  
 [Bridge]
 A7             B7                          Em7         A7
 I'm a war, of head versus heart, and it's always this way
     A7               B7                   Em7               A7      C   G   D
 My head is weak, my heart always speaks before I know what it will say.
  
 C   G   D   x3

 [Chorus]
          C           G         D
 And you can't find nothin' at all
           C           G          D
 if there was nothin' there all along
          C           G         D
 No, you can't find nothin' at all
           C           G          D            D
 if there was nothin' there all along (No, you can't find)
          C           G         D
 And you can't find nothin' at all
           C           G          D
 if there was nothin' there all along
             C         G               D
 There were churches, theme parks and malls
           C        G          D
 there was nothin' there all along
