C                         D
 So, So you think you can tell
            Am                   G
Heaven from hell, blue skys from pain
                     D                       C
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail
               Am                           G
A smile from a veil. Do you think you can tell?
 
G                   C                      D
Did they get you to trade, your heroes for ghosts
              Am                   G
Hot ashes for trees, hot air for a cool breeze
                 D               C
Cold comfort for change. Did you exchange
                      Am                           G
A walk on part in the war for a lead role in the cage?

C                                D
 How I wish, how I wish you were here
          Am
Were just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl
G                D
 Year after year, runnin' over the same old ground
C                                 Am
 What have we found, the same old fears
              G
Wish You Were Here
