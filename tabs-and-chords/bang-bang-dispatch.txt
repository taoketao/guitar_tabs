Lyrics:
She woke me up with a bang bang lookin' over crosseyed 
Had a big hunch that the world was a big lie
When I got up, all the blood to my head
Got so dizzy fell back into my bed
I went over to the way side lookin for the high tide
What will I find will i find will i find find
All I saw was a man that had a hat that had a pom pom
He's been there for years, can someone tell me how long

Wake up to tell me, wake up to show me what I could not find
Wake up to tell me, wake up to show me what I could not find

You see this woman woke me up at a quarter to three
And I didnt know it then but she put a spell on me
Said I had to go down to where the cliffs meet the sea
To meet an old man to present my plea
So I headed way down the big peer
To await and confront my big fear
I wheeled around behind to my blind side 
To find an old man with a lime and kind eye
I said mister mister with your beard so long
Wont you be a saint and tell me just where I'm goin
He pointed to a conk shell and then to the lime
And said this is all I really need to get by

Wake up to tell me, wake up to show me what I could not find
Wake up to tell me, wake up to show me what I could not find

Hey, hey, mister man
I know you dont know who you think I, think I am
But I can safely say
That I shoulda been sleepin been sleepin 
Been sleepin been sleepin the day away
(Somebody pull down the shades)
Hey Hey

I said excuse me, have you got the time
He shrugged his shoulders, said "get a spine"
Coconut hit on me on the head jonesin for a flick
I got booked last night, I need another fix, dig

Yeah, just then I see a twinkle twinkle in the old mans eye
And a wave tossed bottle is thrown to the sky
I caught it on the rebound, it landed with a soft sound
I took out the message, put the bottle down
Inside was the antidote to the spell
And I read it to the man cuz' he couldnt read so well
He said "dont worry bout a thing, you know your path is true
Just ease your mind have a banana or two"
Well goodness goodness whoa is me
The man nearly flipped to learn that he was free
But just before we left he started kickin it
I picked up the bottle and star sixed it
Kick kick shuffle shuffle back to the beach
With a tune on my lips and my quest in reach
That woman comes to you with her song so sweet say
"Damn, let the poor sucker sleep"

Wake up to tell me, wake up to show me what I could not find
Wake up to tell me, wake up to show me what I could not find
